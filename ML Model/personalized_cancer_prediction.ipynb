We explored the effects of KIT inhibition using imatinib mesylate in this molecular subset of disease.  Objective  To assess clinical effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations.  Design, Setting, and Patients  A single-group, open-label, phase 2 trial at 1 community and 5 academic oncology centers in the United States of 295 patients with melanoma screened for the presence of KIT mutations and amplification between April 23, 2007, and April 16, 2010. A total of 51 cases with such alterations were identified and 28 of these patients were treated who had advanced unresectable melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites.  Intervention  Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg orally twice daily.  Main Outcome Measures  Radiographic response, with secondary end points including time to progression, overall survival, and correlation of molecular alterations and clinical response.  Results  Two complete responses lasting 94 (ongoing) and 95 weeks, 2 durable partial responses lasting 53 and 89 (ongoing) weeks, and 2 transient partial responses lasting 12 and 18 weeks among the 25 evaluable patients were observed. The overall durable response rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%\\u201330%), with a median time to progression of 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6\\u201318 weeks; 95% CI, 11\\u201318 weeks), and a median overall survival of 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved). Response rate was better in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots or with a mutant to wild-type allelic ratio of more than 1 (40% vs 0%, P=.05), indicating positive selection for the mutated allele.  Conclusions  Among patients with advanced melanoma harboring KIT alterations, treatment with imatinib mesylate results in significant clinical responses in a subset of patients. Responses may be limited to tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance.  Melanoma causes the greatest morbidity and mortality of all skin cancers.1 An estimated 68 130 invasive melanomas were diagnosed and 8700 deaths due to metastatic disease were recorded in the United States in 2010.2 Dacarbazine,3 interleukin 2,4 and ipilimumab are approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma by the US Food and Drug Administration. Only ipilimumab has been shown to improve overall survival.3\\u20135  Melanomais composed of several biologically distinct subtypes, each with unique genetic and clinical features,6 and each likely to respond differently to any one therapeutic strategy. The most common melanoma subtype in the United States arises from non\\u2212chronically sun-damaged (non-CSD) skin and often harbors activating mutations in BRAF.7 Melanoma arising from mucosal, acral, and CSD sites infrequently have BRAF mutations, but commonly have amplifications or activating mutations of KIT.8,9 KIT is a type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase.10 Binding of its ligand, stem cell factor, results in receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation of several signaling pathways; thereby, mediating cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and inhibition of apoptosis.  The importance of KIT in normal melanocyte development is well established11\\u201313; however, its role as an oncogene and therapeutic target in melanoma has only recently become clear. Although KIT is expressed in some melanomas, loss of expression is observed with progression of disease from superficial to invasive to metastatic stages, suggesting that KIT possesses tumor suppressive functions.14\\u201318 Furthermore, 3 phase 2 studies of metastatic melanoma treated with imatinib mesylate, an orally available ATP-competitive inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases including KIT, did not demonstrate clinical activity.19\\u201321 These trials accrued before the discovery of activating mutations of KIT in melanoma and did not select patients based on the presence of KIT mutations or amplification.  KIT is an established therapeutic target in cancers with activating mutations of KIT, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and significant benefit is achieved with various small molecule inhibitors of KIT including imatinib mesylate.22 Several melanoma cell lines with KIT mutations are highly sensitive to imatinib mesylate.23\\u201325 Furthermore, several patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations, including a K642E mutation as well as a 7-codon duplication of exon 11, have been reported to achieve major durable responses to imatinib mesylate.26,27  Given the preclinical and anecdotal clinical activity of imatinib mesylate observed in KIT mutant melanoma, we conducted this study to test the hypothesis that inhibition of KIT in a molecularly selected subgroup of patients with melanomas harboring mutations or amplification of KIT will result in objective regression and disease control. We further explored whether the identification of functionally relevant KIT alterations would allow us to better select patients most likely to respond to KIT inhibition.  Go to: METHODS Patients  Between April 23, 2007, and April 16, 2010, 328 patients were enrolled from 1 community and 5 academic oncology centers in the United States for molecular screening and determination of eligibility. Eligible patients included those patients aged 18 years or older with metastatic melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and body sites with signs of CSD harboring mutations or amplification of KIT. Patients required an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (able to be fully active and perform all predisease activities without restriction), 1 (unable to perform physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to perform work of a light or sedentary nature, such as light housework or office work), or 2 (ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to perform any work activities),28 life expectancy of 3 months or longer, measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),29 and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Prior systemic therapy and treated stable brain metastases were permitted.  All patients were informed of the investigational nature of the study and provided written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. The protocol was approved by each center\\u2019s institutional review board. Race/ethnicity was self-reported by the participants.  Molecular Screening  Tumor specimens were tested for KIT mutations and amplification. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens as previously published.30 Polymerase chain reaction assays using primers specific for KIT exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18; NRAS exons 1 and 2; BRAF exon 15; and GNAQ exon 5 were used, followed by Sanger sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio) and directly sequenced in the forward and reverse directions using the Applied Biosystems 3730 capillary DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California).  Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections as previously described.23 Human BAC clones RP11-722F1 and CTD-3180G20 spanning KIT in 4q12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), reference clones RP11-365H22 (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, England) and RP11-799E21 (BACPAC Resources, Oakland, California) for proximal 4q, and RP11-19F13 (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) and RP11-461G20(BACPAC Resources) proximal 4p were used.31 BAC DNA was labeled by nick translation with red dUTP (KIT), orange dUTP (4q reference), or green dUTP (4p reference) from Enzo Life Sciences Inc, Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. Analysis used a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope with motorized stage and Isis 5 imaging software (MetaSystems Group, Waltham, Massachusetts). Amplification was defined as a KIT-to-centromere ratio of more than 2.5, with a ratio of more than 10 representing high-level amplification. Polysomy was defined as the presence of discrete red, orange, and green signal groups.  Study Procedures  Patients whose tumors harbored a KIT alteration were eligible to receive imatinib mesylate, 400mgorally twice daily in 6-week cycles until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Imatinib mesylate was supplied by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the National Cancer Institute. Imatinib mesylate was reduced to 400 mg/d in the setting of toxicity, with one further reduction to 300 mg/d permitted. Study participation was discontinued if adverse effects persisted.  Safety evaluations were conducted within 14 days of treatment initiation, every 2 weeks for 18 weeks, and every 6 weeks thereafter. Evaluation included physical examination, complete blood cell count, and clinical chemistry panel, including lactate dehydrogenase. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (available at http://www.ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf).  Radiographic imaging and tumor measurements were performed within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, every 6weeks for 18 weeks, and every 12 weeks subsequently. Response was judged according to RECIST version 1.0.29 All RECIST responses were confirmed by a central radiologist (J.T.).To be considered durable, changes in tumor measurements were confirmed by repeat radiologic assessment performed no less than 6 weeks after the initial response was observed. Stable disease was defined as a less than 30% decreaseorlessthan20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline tumor measurements. Patients receiving 2 or more weeks of imatinib mesylate were evaluable for response. Patients receiving at least 1week of imatinib mesylate were evaluable for toxicity.  Statistical Analysis  The primary end point of this single-group, open-label, phase 2 study was durable objective response defined as partial response or complete response according to RECIST version 1.0.29 Secondary end points included time to progression, overall survival, and correlation of molecular alterations and clinical response.  A Simon 2-stage mini-max design32 was used to assess the primary end point of response, with the following parameters: 10% not promising response rate, 30% promising response rate, and .10 type I and II error rates. If 1 or more durable responses were observed in the first 16 evaluable patients, accrual continued until 25 evaluable patients were identified. If 5 or more durable responses were observed, imatinib mesylate would be considered worthy of further testing in this patient population.  Survival time was defined as the time from initiation of imatinib mesylate to the date of death or last follow-up. Time to progression was defined as the time from initiation of imatinib mesylate to the date of progression or last follow-up. Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.33 Comparisons were made by log-rank test. Baseline patient characteristics and adverse events were reported using summary statistics and frequency tables. Adverse events were reported as the most severe manifestation of each event category during any cycle of treatment. Fisher exact test was used to compare molecular alteration and response. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). All significance tests were 2-sided and used a 5% level of significance.  Go to: RESULTS Molecular Screening  Three hundred twenty-eight patients consented to molecular screening. The flow of patients and tumor testing is shown in eFigure 1 (available at http://www.jama.com). Mutation status for KIT, BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ, and KIT amplification status was determined in 295 cases, including 85 acral melanomas, 93 mucosal melanomas, and 87 melanomas clinically determined to arise from CSD sites. Fifteen melanomas arising from skin without clinical signs of CSD, 1 primary meningeal melanoma, and 14 melanomas of unknown primary site were inadvertently included for screening. KIT mutations or amplification were found in 23.8% (20 of 84 cases) of acral melanomas, 24.7% (23 of 93 cases) of mucosal melanomas, and 9.2% (8 of 87 cases) of melanomas clinically determined to arise from CSD sites. Histopathological confirmation of grade 2 or higher solar elastosis defining CSD34 was performed in 39 of 87 melanomas (44.8%) with clinical signs of CSD. Clinical and histopathological assessments of CSD were concordant in 32 cases (82%). The proportion of histopathologically confirmed CSD melanomas harboring KIT mutations or amplification was 18.8% (6 of 32 cases), twice that observed in melanomas clinically determined to arise from CSD sites (Table 1).NoKIT alterations were identified in the meningeal melanoma, non-CSD melanomas, or melanomas of unknown primary tested.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Treatment Response Over Time by Melanoma Subtype and Genetic Alteration of KIT Table 1 Table 1 Frequency of Alterations Identified in KIT, BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ by Melanoma Subtype Fifty-one cases harbored KIT alterations, including 26 cases (51%) harboring KIT mutations only, 9 (18%) harboring KIT amplification only, and 16 (31%) concurrently harboring both KIT mutations and amplification. The distribution and frequency of mutations identified is shown in eFigure 2. Forty-eight of 51 cases with KIT alterations had no concomitant mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or GNAQ. In total, 162 of 295 samples (54.9%) tested had mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or GNAQ, or a mutation or amplification of KIT (eTable 1).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Radiographic Responses to Imatinib Mesylate Treatment  Twenty-eight of 51 patients whose tumors harbored KIT mutations or amplification were treated during the study (13 [46%] with mucosal melanoma, 10 [36%] with acral melanoma, and 5 [18%] with melanoma arising from CSD sites\\u20143 arising from the head and neck and 2 arising from the trunk). The remaining 23 patients were not treated during the study because of no evidence of active disease (n=9), deceased (n=5), receiving other therapy (n=5), ineligible due to brain metastasis (n=1), ineligible due to increased creatinine (n=1), ineligible due to active human immunodeficiency virus infection (n=1), and ineligible due to the inability to wean off methadone, a contraindicated medication per protocolduetoCYP3A4interactions with imatinib mesylate (n=1). None of the patients who were treated had mutationsin BRAF, NRAS, or GNAQ. Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 2.Twenty-five patients were evaluable for the primary end point of response. Three were evaluable for toxicity only (2 patients stopped treatment within 2 weeks of starting therapy due to rapid disease progression and 1 stopped treatment due to the development of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome within 10 days of initiating imatinib mesylate).  Table 2 Table 2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients The most common adverse events observed are shown in eTable 2. Thirteen of 28 patients (46%) who were treated required a dose reduction to 400 mg/d, with 2 requiring a second dose reduction to 300 mg/d.  Clinical Outcomes  Two patients achieved durable complete responses, 2 achieved durable partial responses, 2 achieved transient partial responses, and 5 achieved stable disease lasting 12 or more weeks. No significant association between clinical melanoma subtype (mucosal: 23%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8%\\u201350%; acral: 38%; 95% CI, 14%\\u201369%; and CSD: 0%; 95% CI, 0%\\u201349%; P = .36) or lactate dehydrogenase (normal: 38%; 95% CI, 18%\\u201361%; vs increased: 0%; 95%CI, 0%\\u201330%; P = .06) and response was observed. RECIST response, time to progression, and KIT alteration identified for each evaluable patient are shown in Figure 1. Representative radiographic images of patients achieving responses are shown in Figure 2. Because 2 of the 6 responses were transient and not sustained on a follow-up scan performed 6 weeks after the initial response was documented, the predetermined end point of 5 responses of 25 evaluable patients who were treated was not met.  The median time to progression was 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6\\u201318 weeks; 95% CI, 11\\u201318 weeks). The 4 patients who achieved durable responses maintained disease control for more than 1 year. Durable disease control was observed in patients achieving stable disease, with 2 such patients maintaining stability for more than 6 months. Median survival from the time of initiation of therapy was 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved), with 10 patients (40%) alive at the time of analysis (Figure 3).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Overall Survival and Time to Progression of All 25 Patients and Those With Recurrent or Sporadic Mutations Five patients underwent optional serial tumor biopsies to determine histopathological and immunohistochemical effects of therapy. One case demonstrating decreased cellularity and reduced tumor proliferation in a clinically responding metastasis compared with both pretreatment sample as well as a clinically progressing lesion is shown in eFigure 3.  Association of Molecular Alterations and Clinical Response  We observed that KIT utations are widely distributed over the coding region as shown in eFigure 2. Many KIT mutations identified in our study have not previously been reported in melanoma8,9 or GIST35,36 and were present only in individual cases, suggesting that some may represent passenger mutations rather than bona fide driver alterations. Specific amino acid changes encountered repeatedly in cancer are likely to be of functional relevance. Interestingly, all 6 responses occurred in tumors with L576P or K642E mutations, the most common mutations in melanoma.8,9 The proportion of responders observed in the 13 cases whose tumors harbored mutations recurrently found in GIST37,38 or melanoma8,9 (V559C, L576P, V642E, and N822K) is 46%, higher than in the group as a whole.  Another method to separate driver from passenger mutations is to identify evidence of positive selection for the mutation. We investigated whether relative abundance of mutant KIT influenced response to imatinib mesylate in 2 ways. First, we assessed whether patients with tumors harboring KIT that was both mutated and amplified were more likely to achieve tumor response than those patients whose tumors harbored either alteration alone. Although a greater likelihood of response was observed in these cases, the difference was not statistically significant (36%; 95% CI, 15%\\u201365%; vs 14%; 95% CI, 4%\\u201340%; P = .35).  We then evaluated whether the ratio of the mutant to wild-type KIT allele influenced response to imatinib mesylate. Mutations associated with a mutant to wild-type allele ratio of more than 1 are likely to be pathogenetically relevant. In a pure population of diploid tumor cells with a heterozygous mutation, this ratio is expected to be 1. As tumor samples typically contain normal cell contamination, the allelic ratio of heterozygous samples is often smaller than 1. Allelic ratios of more than 1 indicate the presence of an independent genetic event, such as amplification of the mutant allele, deletion of the wild-type allele, or loss of heterozygosity, which shifts the ratio in favor of the mutant allele. Such positive selection of the mutated allele suggests that the mutation is a functionally relevant event. Subgroup analysis reveals a higher response rate in cases with an allelic ratio of more than 1 (71% vs 6%; P = .002), with a longer median time to progression (18.0 weeks [IQR, 12.0\\u201395.4 weeks; 95% CI, 11.6\\u201395.4 weeks] vs 11.0 weeks [IQR, 5.0\\u201316.0 weeks; 95% CI, 5.0\\u201312.0 weeks]; P = .01) and extended median survival (median not achieved [IQR, 46.5 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 34.8 weeks-not achieved] vs 31.3 weeks [IQR, 18.1\\u201380.5 weeks; 95% CI, 18.1\\u201361.5 weeks]; P = .03).  Go to: COMMENT These results demonstrate that a subset of melanomas with genetic alterations of KIT respond to treatment with imatinib mesylate. Durable responses were observed in 16% (95% CI, 2%\\u201330%) of these patients, with all sustained for more than 1 year. Two additional responses were observed but not sustained on a follow-up scan performed 6 weeks after the initial response was documented. Therefore, this study did not meet its predetermined end point. Nevertheless, the responses achieved in this population preselected based on the presence of KIT mutations or amplification compare favorably to that observed in prior trials of molecularly unselected patients,19\\u201321 in which response was limited to 1 of 62 evaluable participants treated.  This study additionally highlights the challenges in identifying appropriate patients for treatment with KIT inhibition. Seventy-four percent of BRAF mutant melanomas harbor a substitution of glutamic acid for valine at amino acid 600 (the V600E mutation).39 By contrast, mutations in KIT are more widely distributed over the coding region. Treatment of patients with melanoma harboring the oncogenic V600E BRAF mutation with an effective inhibitor of RAF, such as PLX4032 (Plexxikon, RG7204; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), results in tumor response in 81% of cases.40 The more modest results in this study suggest that only select KIT alterations are truly oncogenic and indicative of an effective therapeutic target.  By using more selective molecular criteria, we may better identify patients who will respond to imatinib mesylate. Response to imatinib mesylate is predicted to be dependent on the region of the protein affected by a mutation, with some mutations affecting the binding affinity of imatinib mesylate to KIT as previously demonstrated in in vitro and clinical studies of GIST.35,37,41 Prior observations in GIST demonstrated the sensitivity of K642E and N822K mutations and the resistance of V654A and D820Y mutations to imatinib mesylate.35,41,42 Concordant with these findings, patients with melanoma harboring these resistant mutations progressed, although disease stability and responses were observed in those patients whose tumors harbored K642E and N822K mutations (Figure 1). Imatinib mesylate\\u2013resistance in GIST commonly results from the development of secondary KIT mutations, including V654A, D820Y, N822K, and A829P.35,36 These mutations were identified as primary mutations in several melanomas and may also predict a lower probability of response with imatinib mesylate. Indeed, the best response we observed in such cases was stable disease. Importantly, although an in vitro study demonstrated poor sensitivity of a melanoma cell line harboring an L576P mutation to imatinib mesylate,43 we observed dramatic in vivo responses in patients with melanomas harboring this mutation.  To separate bona fide driver from passenger alterations of KIT, we sought evidence for tumor selection of specific mutations. We observed that imatinib mesylate has greater activity in tumors harboring recurrent KIT mutations found in melanoma or GIST, as well as in tumors with a mutant KIT allele in greater abundance than the wild-type allele. When combining those patients whose tumors have an allelic ratio of more than 1 with those whose tumors harbor recurrent primary mutations found in GIST or melanoma, we observed a better response rate, time to progression, and overall survival compared with other cases (Figure 3). These criteria may serve as indicators of genetic events relevant to oncogenesis and should be investigated further as predictive markers of response to KIT inhibition.  In conclusion, our data show that imatinib mesylate therapy in patients with melanoma harboring specific KIT alterations results in clinical responses, consistent with the paradigm of oncogene addiction.44 Prediction of response to KIT inhibition can be improved beyond what we report herein by identifying tumors that harbor KIT alterations of functional relevance.\",\n          \"Critical determinants of DNA recognition by p53 have been identified by a molecular genetic approach. The wild-type human p53 fragment containing amino acids 71 to 330 (p5371-330) was used for in vitro DNA binding assays, and full-length human p53 was used for transactivation assays with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First, we defined the DNA binding specificity of the wild-type p53 fragment by using systematically altered forms of a known consensus DNA site. This refinement indicates that p53 binds with high affinity to two repeats of PuGPuCA.TGPyCPy, a further refinement of an earlier defined consensus half site PuPuPuC(A/T).(T/A) GPyPyPy. These results were further confirmed by transactivation assays of yeast by using full-length human p53 and systematically altered DNA sites. Dimers of the pentamer AGGCA oriented either head-to-head or tail-to-tail bound efficiently, but transactivation was facilitated only through head-to-head dimers. To determine the origins of specificity in DNA binding by p53, we identified mutations that lead to altered specificities of DNA binding. Single-amino-acid substitutions were made at several positions within the DNA binding domain of p53, and this set of p53 point mutants were tested with DNA site variants for DNA binding. DNA binding analyses showed that the mutants Lys-120 to Asn, Cys-277 to Gln or Arg, and Arg-283 to Gln bind to sites with noncanonical base pair changes at positions 2, 3, and 1 in the pentamer (PuGPuCA), respectively. Thus, we implicate these residues in amino acid-base pair contacts. Interestingly, mutant Cys-277 to Gln bound a consensus site as two and four monomers, as opposed to the wild-type p53 fragment, which invariably binds this site as four monomers. The gene for the tumor suppressor protein p53 is commonly mutated in human tumorigenesis (15, 22, 27, 35). Wild-type p53 negatively regulates cell growth and division, whereas p53 mutants do not suppress cell growth and in some cases can promote the growth of tumor cells (5, 10, 14, 20). The physiological pathway of p53 in the control of cell growth is not clearly understood. However, there is considerable evidence for regulation of transcription as a mechanism of p53 action. p53 protein is capable of specific DNA binding and transactivation, which are necessary for suppression of cellular transformation (1, 8, 9, 13, 19, 29, 34). Most of the natural mutations associated with tumorigenesis occur in the central domain of p53, which is essential for interaction with DNA (2, 13, 28, 33, 37), T antigen (23, 30), and cellular proteins p53BP1 and p53BP2 (16). Natural mutations occurring in this domain result in the loss of DNA binding and transactivation (19, 25, 29, 34). Several DNA binding sites of wild-type p53 have previously been described; these include repeats of the pentamer TGCCT (1, 8), two copies of the 10-bp motif PuPuPuC(A/ T)(T/A)GPyPyPy (6, 11), and variations of this latter motif in some genes (7, 18, 26, 38\\u201340). The crystal structure of the DNA binding domain has provided some insight into the origin of specificity in p53-DNA interactions (3). Recently, we identified several p53 residues that were implicated in specific DNA binding by alanine mutagenesis (33). In this paper, we identify amino acid-base pair contacts in the p53-consensus DNA complex by a genetic approach. First, systematic alterations of the known p53 consensus DNA site were made, and the binding specificity of wildtype p53 was determined. We then made several single-aminoacid substitutions by in vitro mutagenesis of the DNA binding domain of p53. This set of p53 point mutants and DNA site variants was used to identify contacts in the p53-DNA complex between individual amino acids of p53 and individual base pairs of the DNA site. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutagenesis and expression of p53. The phagemid pRSET A(L) was used for mutagenesis and expression in Escherichia coli of p53 with a histidine tag at its N terminus. Cloning of the wild-type p53 fragment, p5371-330, encoding amino acids 71 to 330 into pRSET A(L) has been described previously (33). For in vitro mutagenesis of p53, a uracil-containing template, pRSET A(L)-p53, was obtained by coinfecting this phagemid with M13K07 helper phage into E. coli CJ236. Synthetic oligonucleotides bearing the appropriate mismatches were used to synthesize a second strand from the uracil-containing template. Doublestranded DNA sequencing was performed to screen for correct mutants. The conditions for induction and purification of proteins have been described previously (33). Briefly, total protein extracts made from IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside)-induced cells were clarified by centrifugation and passed through a Ni nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and proteins were step eluted with native imidazole elution buffer. Plasmids for p53 transactivation assays. Plasmid pY10-p53 was used for expression of the wild-type human p53 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (33). This plasmid contains 2mm sequences, the TRP1 gene for selection in yeast, the Bla gene for selection in E. coli, and the p53 gene under the control of the yeast ADH1 promoter. The reporter plasmid pY28, which is derived from pLGK669Z, is a URA3, 2mm-based plasmid containing the CyC1-lacZ gene (12, 33). Doublestranded 43-bp oligonucleotides containing 20-bp canonical and noncanonical p53 binding sites and flanked by identical sequences were ligated into KpnIXhoI-digested pY28. For transactivation assays, yeast CM1 cells were cotransformed with plasmid pY10-p53 and reporter plasmid pY28 containing one copy of the consensus binding site or a variant binding site. DNA binding assays. DNA binding assays were performed with a purified p53 fragment containing amino acids 71 to 330 and expressed in E. coli. The DNA sites used in binding assays are listed in the appropriate figures. The flanking sequences of consensus and altered double-stranded DNA sites were identical; the upper strand from 59 to 39 was CAA ACG CGT AGC C (binding site) TCG CGA CAG GTC C. p53 protein was incubated in 25 ml of binding buffer (25 mM HEPES [N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N9-2-ethanesulfonic acid], 50 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml) at room temperature for 20 min in the presence of 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) and 1 ng * Corresponding author.

Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% acrylamide gels (0.53 Tris-borate-EDTA), and the gels were dried and autoradiographed. For competition assays, binding reactions were mixed with increasing amounts of unlabeled DNA. The amounts of free and bound DNA were quantitated by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Cross-linking of p53 in p53-DNA complexes. The stoichiometries of p53-DNA complexes of wild-type p53 and p53 mutant C-2773Q (C277Q) were determined by protein cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. DNA binding assays were performed with an end-labeled radioactive DNA probe containing the 20-bp p53 binding site A1G (see Fig. 1). p53 complexes were excised from a preparative scale mobility shift gel and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde. Complexes were eluted, concentrated with a microcentricon-100 (Amicon), boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer, run on an SDS\\u201310% polyacrylamide gel, and blotted to nitrocellulose, and p53 protein was detected with pAb 240 antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure using an ECL kit (Amersham). Yeast strain, growth conditions, and b-galactosidase assays. S. cerevisiae CM1 (MATa pep4-3 trp1D ura3) was used in this study. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose or appropriate selective minimal media. b-Galactosidase assays were done in liquid cultures. Five-milliliter yeast cultures were grown in the appropriate selective media to an optical density at 600 nm of between 0.8 to 1.0. Cells were then prepared and permeabilized as previously described (24). Activities are reported in units as defined by Miller (24). RESULTS DNA binding specificity of p53. To evaluate the DNA binding specificities of wild-type p53, all 15 possible symmetrical mutations in both copies of the 10-bp palindromic sequence were made (Fig. 1a). According to the nomenclature used in Fig. 1, A1C represents symmetric changes at positions 1 and 19 of AGGCA.TGCCT from AT to CG and from TA to GC, respectively, in both repeats. Mutant binding sites were evaluated for DNA binding by wild-type p53 and for the ability to transactivate in yeast. A compilation of data is presented in Fig. 1b. Mobility shift assays with the wild-type p53 segment containing amino acids 71 to 330 and variant DNA sites showed that changing the guanine at position 2, cytosine at position 4, or adenine at position 5 resulted in the loss of all detectable binding. At positions 1 and 3, either purine was acceptable. Wild-type p53 exhibits strong specificity for an AT or GC base pair at position 1 of the DNA site; however, binding was adversely affected by a TA or CG base pair substitution at this position. At position 3, AT and GC base pairs were equally acceptable, but TA and CG substitutions resulted in the complete loss of DNA binding. In vitro DNA binding was corroborated by yeast-based transactivation assays with mutant DNA sites in a minimal CYC1-lacZ promoter and expression of wild-type full-length p53 (Fig. 1b). Thus, on the basis of these data, the deduced consensus binding site is two copies of the 10-bp motif PuGPuCA.TGPyCPy. This sequence is a further refinement of the previously reported consensus sequence PuPuPuC(A/T).(T/A)GPyPyPy (6, 11). The G at position 2 and A at position 5 of the pentamer PuPuPuC(A/T) appear to be critical for high-affinity DNA binding activity and transactivation. Orientation requirement of quarter DNA site repeats for high-affinity DNA binding by p53. We further investigated the orientation requirement of the pentamer quarter sites for highaffinity DNA binding and transactivation by p53. Consensus p53 binding consists of two repeats of head-to-head (h-h) dimers of pentamer quarter sites (RE1) (Fig. 2). DNAs containing two repeats, either h-h (RE1) or tail-to-tail (RE2), performed equally well in competition with BS-2. Surprisingly, p53 did not transactivate through RE2, indicating that the h-h orientation of pentamer repeats is important for transactivation. Efficient competition by RE2 of the p53-DNA complex might have resulted from the presence of three pentamer repeats, each in an orientation similar to that in RE1. Since this orientation is shifted by 5 bp relative to that in RE1, the p53 complex is rotated half a turn on the DNA, possibly removing important interactions with p53 subunits or other transcriptional factors and thus resulting in the loss of transactivation. Binding sites with a single dyad in h-h orientation (RE3), two or three pentamer repeats that are 0 or 5 bp apart (RE3 to RE7), or four direct repeats (RE8) were poor competitors of the p53-consensus DNA complex and did not transactivate. RE9, which contains five repeats of the pentamer quarter site 5 bp apart, was able to compete and transactivate to a limited degree. Identification of amino acid-base pair contacts. Residues K-120, R-248, R-249, R-273, C-277, R-280, D-281, R-282, and R-283 were chosen for further mutagenesis on the basis of alanine scanning mutagenesis (33) and the p53 crystal structure (3). Several amino acid changes were made at each position. By in vitro mutagenesis, we replaced K-120 with Arg, Gln, Asn, Thr, Glu, Asp, and His; C-277 with Arg, Lys, Gln, Asn, Thr, Glu, Asp, and His; D-281 with Arg, Lys, His, Thr, Gln, Asn, and Glu; and R-248, R-249, R-273, R-280, R-282, and R-283 with Lys, His, Thr, Gln, Asn, Asp, and Glu. Mutant p53 proteins were expressed as p53 fragments containing amino acids 71 to 330 in E. coli and were purified to approximately 80% homogeneity by using a His tag. All proteins were soluble and expressed in bacteria at levels of 5 to 7% of total cell protein (steady-state levels). All subsequent p53 mutant designations are based on the single-letter amino acid code (e.g., R248K is Arg-248 changed to Lys). Mutant proteins were used for DNA binding assays with labeled BS-2 and symmetrically altered binding sites. Only 7 of 65 p53 mutants containing FIG. 1. DNA-binding specificity of wild-type p53. (a) DNA sequence of the consensus site used in p53 binding studies. The upper-strand DNA sequence of the bases flanking this site was 59 CAA ACG CGT AGC C (binding site) TCG CGA CAG GTC C 39, which is unrelated to the consensus site. (b) Oligonucleotides containing symmetric changes in BS-2 were chemically synthesized with 13-base flanking sequences on each end as described in Materials and Methods. A1C represents a change at the first position of the pentamer AGGCA from the AT base pair to the CG base pair in both dyads, as well as the symmetric changes at position 19 shown in panel a. One nanogram of the indicated end-labeled DNA site and 50 ng of the E. coli-expressed and purified p53 fragment containing amino acids 71 to 330 were incubated in DNA binding buffer. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% acrylamide gels (0.53 Tris-borate-EDTA). For transactivation assays, CM1 cells were cotransformed with plasmid pY10-p53, encoding full-length human p53, and pY28, a minimal CYC1-lacZ reporter plasmid containing one copy of BS-2 or the indicated variant binding site. Five-milliliter cultures of strain CM1 were grown in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose and lacking uracil and tryptophan for plasmid selection to an optical density of 1.0. Cells were prepared, and b-galactosidase enzyme activities were determined as previously described (24). Enzyme activities are reported in Miller units (24) and are averages of three independent assays. VOL. 15, 1995 DNA BINDING SPECIFICITY MUTANTS OF p53 5197 single-amino-acid substitutions had detectable binding. Four of these seven mutants had altered DNA binding specificities. The activities of all mutants that resulted in any detectable binding are summarized in Table 1. Mobility shift assays of mutants with new binding specificities or a loss-of-contact phenotype are shown in Fig. 3. No mutants of R-249, R-280, D-281, or R-282 showed any detectable DNA binding with canonical or noncanonical sites, emphasizing their critical structural roles in p53-DNA interactions. Mutants R283Q, K120N, and both C277Q and C277R bound to variant sites containing base pair changes at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in the consensus pentamer to which the wild type p53 did not bind (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The binding specificities of these mutant p53 proteins were similar to that of wild-type p53 at all other positions (Fig. 1 and 3). R283Q bound to A1T, to which the wild-type protein bound very poorly. Mutant K120N preferentially recognized altered base pairs CG and TA at position 2, to which wild-type p53 is unable to bind. Mutants C277Q and C277R displayed new specificity phenotypes at position 3 by binding to variant site G3T much better than it bound to BS-2. C277Q also displayed detectable binding activity to mutant site G3C. On the basis of these data, FIG. 2. Competition experiments that show affinities to pentamer quarter sites in different orientations. (A) Binding reactions similar to those in Fig. 1A that contained p5371-330 and labeled BS-2 were challenged with increasing amounts (0, 2, 5, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, and 500 ng) of the indicated unlabeled DNA. Gels were dried, and the amounts of free and bound labeled DNA was quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The percent DNA bound was plotted against the log10 of the amount of competitor used in each experiment. (B) The amount of each competitor required to reduce DNA binding by 50% is indicated. For transactivation assays, reporter plasmid pY28 containing the indicated DNA sites and pY10-p53 were introduced into yeast strain CM1. b-Galactosidase activities are reported in Miller units (24) and were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1. 4, the pentamer repeat, TGCCT. 5198 THUKRAL ET AL. MOL. CELL. BIOL. R-283, K-120, and C-277 are implicated in interactions with bases at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of the pentamer repeat PuGPuCA. None of the R-248 and R-273 mutations resulted in binding to additional sites. However, analysis of mutant R248K showed that it was unable to bind the consensus site or any variant at position 3, in contrast to wild-type p53. It retained wild-type specificity at position 1 by binding to variant A1G efficiently. This loss of R248K binding with respect to base pair position 3 suggests that the R-248 side chain is critical for recognition of Pu at position 3. Stoichiometry of p53 binding. In gel mobility shift assays of mutant C277Q, an additional faster-migrating complex (C-II) was observed (Fig. 3 and 4A). The wild-type p53 fragment containing amino acids 71 to 330 (p5371-330) but lacking the oligomerization domain (amino acids 325 to 365) invariably shows one complex (C-I) with a consensus binding site (Fig. 1 and 4A). At higher protein concentrations, C-II could also be driven into the slower mobility complex, C-I (Fig. 4A). To investigate the oligomeric states of p53 in C-I and C-II, glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed at various concentrations of the cross-linker to achieve partial cross-linking between p53 molecules. Cross-linked p53 molecules were fractionated on a denaturing gel. Protein was detected by a Western blot (immunoblot) with anti-p53 antibodies. Under FIG. 3. DNA binding activities of p53 mutants. E. coli-expressed and purified p53 fragments with the indicated amino acid substitutions were analyzed by mobility shift assays with end-labeled DNA probes containing symmetric changes corresponding to positions 1, 2, and 3 of pentamer quarter site AGGCA as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Fifty nanograms of mutant protein and 1 ng of labeled BS-2 or mutant variant DNA site were used in all DNA binding reactions. FIG. 4. Stoichiometries of p53-DNA complexes of wild-type p5371-330 and the C277Q mutant. (A) The conditions for DNA binding assays were the same as those described in the legend to Fig. 1. The indicated amounts of protein and 1 ng of radioactive probe containing the 20-bp p53 binding site A1G (Fig. 1) were used in DNA binding assays. (B) C-I and C-II were excised from preparative scale mobility shift gel assays of C277Q and wild-type p53 with A1G. p53 protein (250 ng) was used in 53 DNA binding reaction mixture for each assay. Excised complexes were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the indicated concentrations of glutaraldehyde. p53 complexes were eluted, concentrated with a microcentricon-100, boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and run on an SDS\\u201310% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were immunoblotted with pAb 240 antibody and detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure using an ECL kit from Amersham. TABLE 1.

VOL. 15, 1995 DNA BINDING SPECIFICITY MUTANTS OF p53 5199 conditions of partial cross-linking, C-I migrated as four bands, resolving at Rf s of a tetramer, trimer, dimer, and monomer of p53. At higher glutaraldehyde concentrations, C-I resulted in increased intensity of oligomeric p53. C-II resolved into two bands, corresponding to a dimer and monomer, under partial cross-linking conditions, and shifted to more dimer p53 at higher cross-linker concentrations (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that four monomers of wild-type p5371-330 bind to the site containing two repeats of the h-h site. This observation, together with the absence of any faster-migrating mobility complex, demonstrates that binding by the wild-type p53 fragment which lacks the oligomerization domain is highly cooperative. In the case of C277Q, the appearance of C-II may result from reduced interaction between p53 molecules on DNA. DISCUSSION Two repeats of the 10-bp motif PuPuPuC(A/T)z(T/A)GPyPyPy were determined to be high-affinity binding sites for p53 on the basis of a binding site selection-amplification assay (6). Further investigation of this binding site revealed that the wild-type p53 fragment binds with high affinity to two repeats of motif PuGPuCAzTGPyCPy. The G and A at positions 2 and 5, respectively, in the pentameric quarter site are critical determinants of p53 DNA binding. A G and an A were also present at these positions in the high-affinity p53 binding site reported by Funk et al., which had been obtained from a mixture of random sequences synthesized in vitro (11). In the crystal structure of the p53-DNA complex, only one monomer bound to the dimer site GGGCAAGTCT (3). This may have been the result of the presence of an unfavorable adenine at the underlined position. A T at this position seems critical for high-affinity binding by p53. High-affinity DNA binding and transactivation through four pentameric quarter sites arranged in an orientation of two h-h dimers indicate that proper positioning of p53 molecules on DNA is important for transactivation. RE2, which also contains four quarter sites but as two tail-to-tail dimers, was effective in the DNA binding assay but did not result in transactivation. In the tail-to-tail DNA site, the orientation of p53 subunits on DNA is different, which perhaps affects the intermolecular interactions between p53 subunits and the other proteins involved in transcription. Alternatively, the difference in DNA binding activity and transactivation may be due to the difference in sizes of p53 used in the two experiments. p53 also bound and transactivated through RE9, which contains pentamer repeats 5 bp apart. Transcriptional activity through this site was 10-fold lower than that through the consensus RE1 site. A naturally occurring arrangement of pentamers, similar to that in RE9, through which p53 transactivates has been reported previously (8). In addition, model building studies of p53 and mass spectroscopic study of the p53-DNA complex have indicated that the linker between the oligomerization and DNA binding domains is flexible, allowing some variability in the spacing of individual DNA binding domains on the DNA, in general agreement with the observations made here (17, 21, 31). Amino acid-base pair interactions between p53 and its consensus DNA site were inferred from DNA binding specificity mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53. The conclusions based on the behavior of these mutants support and extend observed interactions in the p53-DNA crystal structure (3). No mutants of R-249, R-280, D-281, or R-282 showed any detectable DNA binding with canonical or noncanonical sites, emphasizing their structural roles. In the crystal structure, the guanidinium group of R-280 donates two hydrogen bonds to N-6 and O-6 of the invariant guanine in the CG base pair at position 4. It is also involved in salt bridge formation with the carboxylate of D-281. Even a conservative change to lysine was ineffective, emphasizing the importance of arginine at this position. In conjunction with the results for DNA site variants, these data strongly suggest the critical roles of the cytosine at position 4 and the R-280 side chain in governing the DNA binding specificity of wild-type p53. The side chains of R-249, D-281, and R-282 do not make any direct contacts with DNA but are involved in forming a network of interactions that stabilize the DNA binding region of p53. Interactions between the original and substituted amino acids of altered-specificity mutants of p53 with their cognate DNA sites seem chemically feasible. K120N, C277Q, C277R, and R283Q bound to variant sites to which wild-type p53 did not bind. R283Q bound efficiently to A1T, to which the wildtype protein did not bind, and also to A1G. These variant bases provide hydrogen bond acceptors in their O-4 and O-6 positions, respectively, together with hydrogen bond donor groups from the complementary base pair. This is reversed in the original base pair, AT, and variant A1C, which may account for the origin of this observation. Mutant K120N preferentially recognized base pairs TA and CG at position 2, to which wild-type p53 did not bind. The reduction in side chain length with the change from K to N may result in the observed change in preference from purine to pyrimidine at this position. In the crystal structure, the side chain of K-120 donates hydrogen bonds to N-7 and O-6 of G at position 2 in the pentamer quarter site. The amide side chain of the substituted amino acid in K120N may hydrogen bond with variant base pairs at position 2. Substitutions C277Q and C277R also bound variant DNA sites that wild-type p53 did not recognize. In wild-type p53, C277 is suggested to have two potential modes of interaction with target DNA, either accepting a hydrogen bond from N-4 of cytosine in the GC base pair at position 3 or donating a hydrogen bond to O-4 of thymidine in the AT at position 3. Thus, C277Q and C277R may switch between these two interactions, both of which are stronger than the wild type. Alternatively, the longer side chain of C277R may permit it to form interactions with the phosphate backbone as well as the base pairs. Genetic analysis has also identified a direct role for the R-248 side chain in DNA binding. This residue is one of the most frequently mutated in various human cancers. R248K binds efficiently to GGGCA (A1G [Table 1]). It has lost contact with G3A, to which wild-type p53 binds strongly. Our data indicate the importance of the guanidinium group of arginine at this position in discriminating base pair changes at position 3. On the basis of these results, both C-277 and R-248 contribute to recognition of the base pair at position 3. In the crystal structure study, the role of the R-248 side chain in governing DNA binding specificity was not clear. This residue was close to the minor groove of DNA. However, the DNA site used in the X-ray crystal study was different from the one used in this analysis; perhaps this resulted in the differences between the two observations. Analysis of various substitutions at R-273 showed that only R273K was able to partially replace the binding specificity of R-273, indicating the importance of positive charge and the guanidinium group. Consistent with this result, in the p53-DNA crystal structure, the guanidinium group of R-273 makes DNA backbone contact with the base pair at position 5 and is also involved in salt bridge formation with D-281. Interestingly, in gel mobility shift assays of mutant C277Q, an additional faster-migrating complex was observed. The wild-type p53 fragment containing amino acids 71 to 330 but lacking the oligomerization domain (4, 17, 21, 32) invariably 5200 THUKRAL ET AL. MOL. CELL. BIOL. shows one complex with a consensus binding site. Analysis of more slowly and faster-migrating mobility bands showed that these contain four and two monomers of p53, respectively. Earlier studies have indicated that the p53 fragment which lacks the oligomerization domain, though predominantly monomers in solution, still has a tendency to associate into oligomers (36). Thus, this tendency of the wild-type p53 fragment lacking the oligomerization domain to associate in solution may result in highly cooperative DNA binding. Structural studies of the oligomerization domain have indicated that monomer-monomer interactions in the formation of a dimer are more extensive and stronger than interactions between dimers to form tetramers (17, 21). Furthermore, model building studies of the p53 DNA binding domain (3) suggested that protein-protein contacts between dimers, possibly by the H1 helices of the DNA binding domain, result in further oligomerization. Perhaps these interactions between p53 subunits contribute to highly cooperative DNA binding by the p53 fragment lacking the oligomerization domain. C-277 mutants may affect this activity. With the stoichiometry of one monomer per pentamer, four monomers bind to four pentameric quarter sites in the h-h orientation. High-affinity DNA binding and transactivation through quarter sites arranged in this orientation suggest that proper positioning of p53 molecules on DNA is important for transactivation. Since each pentamer repeat in an h-h dimer represents half a turn in the DNA helix, monomeric p53 proteins are likely to be present on the same surface of DNA, as has been proposed by Cho et al. (3). While this paper was under review, Wang et al. published a study of the interaction of p53 with its consensus DNA site (37a). That study indicated that the p53 fragment lacking the tetramerization domain also binds the consensus DNA site with a high degree of cooperative interactions. Furthermore, by altering the spacing within the half and full consensus sites, they suggest that p53 binds DNA with rotational specificity. Molecular genetic analysis of the p53-DNA complex, together with the crystal study, provides a general framework for p53-DNA interactions. However, the natural response elements identified so far usually differ at two to three critical base pair positions from the consensus site or only contain half a consensus site (7, 18, 26, 38, 40). In vitro binding studies show that wild-type p53 binds poorly to a single h-h sequence and does not transactivate in yeast-based assays. These results argue that wild-type p53 might bind to native DNA sites with different kinetics and/or require another protein(s) for efficient binding and regulation of genes. Additionally, the characterizations of p53 mutants in this study that possess altered DNA binding specificities also suggest that natural mutants bind as yet unidentified DNA sites that are suboptimal for wild-type p53. Though this is speculation at present, it is indeed plausible, given the existence of natural p53 mutants which result in gains of function (5).\",\n          \" Abstract Exposure to herbal remedies containing the carcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) has been widespread in some regions of the world. Rare A\\u2192T TP53 mutations were recently discovered in AA-associated urothelial cancers. The near absence of these mutations among all other sequenced human tumors suggests that they could be biologically silent. There are no cell banks with established lines derived from human tumors with which to explore the influence of the novel mutants on p53 function and cellular behavior. To investigate their impact, we generated isogenic mutant clones by integrase-mediated cassette exchange at the p53 locus of platform (null) murine embryonic fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells. Common tumor mutants (R248W, R273C) were compared with the AA-associated mutants N131Y, R249W, and Q104L. Assays of cell proliferation, migration, growth in soft agar, apoptosis, senescence, and gene expression revealed contrasting outcomes on cellular behavior following introduction of N131Y or Q104L. The N131Y mutant demonstrated a phenotype akin to common tumor mutants, whereas Q104L clone behavior resembled that of cells with wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 responses were restored in double-mutant cells harboring N131Y and N239Y, a second-site rescue mutation, suggesting that pharmaceutical reactivation of p53 function in tumors expressing N131Y could have therapeutic benefit. N131Y is likely to contribute directly to tumor phenotype and is a promising candidate biomarker of AA exposure and disease. Rare mutations thus do not necessarily point to sites where amino acid exchanges are phenotypically neutral. Encounter with mutagenic insults targeting cryptic sites can reveal specific signature hotspots.  Keywords: Cancer Biology, Cellular Senescence, Molecular Cell Biology, Mouse Genetics, Mutagenesis Mechanisms, Tumor Suppressor Gene, Biomarkers, Site-specific Recombination, Suppressor Mutations Go to: Introduction It is well appreciated that common TP53 mutations in human cancers confer neoplastic properties to the mutant cells (1\\u20133). As expected for driver mutations in cancer, TP53 missense mutations that are common have been shown to obliterate wild-type p53 tumor suppressor functions. In addition, some mutant proteins, which usually accumulate to abnormally high levels, even acquire new oncogenic activities that contribute to the cancer phenotype (4). In a landmark comprehensive study of all possible amino acid substitutions in p53, an excellent correlation was shown between the frequency with which a TP53 mutation has been observed in tumors and the extent to which the mutation compromises p53 wild-type function (5). In contrast, various amino acid substitutions in p53 that have never or rarely been found in cancers are considered more likely to allow retention of normal p53 function (6). At sites where mutations in tumors are infrequent, amino acid substitutions may have no serious deleterious consequences for the cancer-suppressing activities of the p53 protein. Sequence changes at these locations thus could behave as passenger mutations that are not specifically selected for during carcinogenesis (7, 8). In specific circumstances, however, certain mutations may have been observed infrequently simply because endogenous mutagenic processes or external exposures encountered thus far do not target the base change and sequence context in question.  In a recent study of aristolochic acid (AA)3-associated urothelial cancers in Taiwanese patients, an uncommon TP53 missense mutation, N131Y, was discovered in multiple tumors (9). This is a remarkable finding, considering that none of the >20,000 p53 mutations found in human cancers during the initial two decades of research were N131Y mutations (International Agency for Research on Cancer database, version R12). Eight tumors with the N131Y mutation have now been found in urothelial cancer patients (9, 10). A key factor these patients have in common is exposure to AA, either from medicinal herbal preparations containing extracts of Aristolochia sp., as is the case for the Taiwanese patients, or from consuming grains from fields where Aristolochia also flourishes. The codon 131 AAC to TAC (N131Y) mutation remains an exceedingly rare mutation in other cohorts and cancers (11, 12) (International Agency for Research on Cancer database, version R15; supplemental Table 1). The characteristic feature of the AA-associated tumor mutation spectrum is the high proportion (59%) of A\\u2192T substitutions. A\\u2192T transversion is an uncommon spontaneous sequence change in mammalian cells, and most known human carcinogens preferentially induce other types of base changes. In addition to N131Y, several other unusual A\\u2192T mutations emerged from analysis of AA-associated tumors, such as an A\\u2192T transversion in exon 4, Q104L, which has been observed only once among >25,000 non-AA associated cancers with TP53 mutations (supplemental Table 1). There are no human cell lines in repositories or archives derived from tumors that harbor N131Y or Q104L, so it is not surprising that there is little experimental data on their impact, if any, on cellular behavior.  Our objective here was to determine whether N131Y and Q104L are simply passenger mutations or are indeed driver mutations, and if the latter, to describe their detrimental effects. To achieve this goal, we first generated a panel of p53 mutant clones from primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using a procedure that allows precise importation of human TP53 sequences into the endogenous murine p53 locus (see Fig. 1A). Integrase-mediated cassette exchange (IMCE) in p53 platform (p53 null) MEFs allows for isolation of distinct mutant clones with a common genetic background (13). We then examined the rare AA-associated TP53 mutations for their impact on the properties of the different clones. The functional consequences of harboring the N131Y mutation were confirmed in integrase-targeted baby platform mouse kidney (BMK) cells as well as the p53 null human lung carcinoma cell line, H1299. Importantly, we were able to recover several wild-type p53 functions by introducing a \\u201cglobal\\u201d secondary suppressor mutation, N239Y, onto the N131Y mutant. This switch was sufficient to blunt the growth promoting effects of the mutant. An AA signature mutation that is otherwise rare yet displays biochemical and phenotypic hallmarks typical of universally common TP53 tumor mutants would be a biomarker candidate of choice and would represent a potential target for specific therapies directed against dysfunctional p53.

B and C, platform MEFs transfected with TOP plasmids containing the indicated ... Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmids, Transfection, and Cell Culture Plasmids for use in IMCE have been described previously (14). Briefly, plasmids designed for IMCE at the Trp53 locus of the p53 (null) platform mouse are referred to as TOP plasmids for \\u201ctargeting on platform\\u201d (see Fig. 1A). AA mutations were generated in TOP plasmids, pcDNA3-p53 and pWt1-p53 (pX42) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, Leicester UK) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into platform MEFs, BMKs, and H1299 cells using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Nanofectin (PAA Laboratories; GE Healthcare) and selected as described previously (13) or with G418 (1 mg/ml). H1299 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. IMCE-derived cells are referred to either as clones, when single clones are used, or as pooled when the whole resistant population is used in a biological assay. MEF IMCE clones with dysfunctional p53 mutations can grow indefinitely as cell lines. Transient knockdown of p53 was performed using siRNA transfected with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Primary platform MEFs used for introduction of TOP constructs were prepared from 13.5-day-old embryos of plf/plf mice and grown as described previously (14) (European Mouse Mutant Archive; B6;129P2 (p53)TM182/DKFZ)). BMKs were isolated from 5-day-old mice by dispase II/collagenase I treatment and grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% FCS. In some experiments, BMKs were co-transfected with either c-Myc or Ad12E1A constructs (15).  Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcg) using the GoScript Reverse Transcription system (Promega, Southhampton, UK). Real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with primer sets shown in supplemental Table 2. Gene expression determination was performed on an ABI 7900HT Fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the \\u0394\\u0394CT method against GAPDH.  Cell Migration and Proliferation Assays Cell migration toward a 10% FCS gradient was determined using modified Transwell filter assay (Falcon, BD Biosciences). Filters were fixed after 18 h and stained with crystal violet, and migrated cells were counted across four independent fields/filter. To analyze cell growth over a 4-day period, 4000\\u20136000 cells per well were seeded in triplicate into 24-well plates. In 24-h intervals, cells were fixed and stained in a 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet/10% methanol solution for 30 min before washing. Dried samples were extracted with 10% acetic acid, and absorbance was measured at 590 nm. Cell proliferation was also determined using a BrdU ELISA assay performed in 96-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) (13).  Colony Formation Assays Following transfection of TOP constructs and PhiC31 integrase into platform MEFs, 5 \\u00d7 104 cells were seeded in triplicate into 24-well plates. Puromycin selection was maintained for 5 days, after which cells were fixed in formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution. Colonies were either counted or stain-extracted and measured at 590 nm. For analysis of anchorage-independent cell growth, 1 \\u00d7 104 cells were mixed with 1.4% (w/v) agarose to form a 0.35% agarose final solution containing 10% FCS supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin. This cell solution was overlaid onto a 0.7% (w/v) agarose/DMEM solution preformed in triplicate in six-well plates. Wells were overlaid with normal growth medium, which was replaced every 5\\u20137 days. After 14\\u201321 days, colonies were scored, counted, and size-determined using NIH ImageJ analysis software.  Analysis of Apoptosis Induction and Determination of Senescence Cells subjected to overnight camptothecin treatment (10 \\u03bcm) were trypsinized and labeled on ice for 30 min with annexin V-FITC solution (Molecular Probes). Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide prior to analysis by flow cytometry using a BD-LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using DiVa software (version 6, BD Biosciences). For senescence determination, untreated or treated cells were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and stained for \\u03b2-galactosidase expression using a \\u03b2-galactosidase staining kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). Random fields from each condition were recorded using digital light microscopy, and percentage of blue cells was determined.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with camptothecin (1 \\u03bcm; 18 h) prior to fixation in 10% formalin and staining with anti-p53 (FL393 or pab1801) and goat anti-p21 antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI, and cells were analyzed on a Zeiss MetaFluor LSM510 confocal microscope.  Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean \\u00b1 S.E.

Go to: RESULTS The AA-associated p53 Mutants, N131Y and Q104L, Have Contrasting Outcomes on Cell Behavior To begin this study, we used IMCE to create a panel of MEF clones containing specific AA-associated TP53 missense mutations that encode the mutant p53 proteins Q104L, N131Y, R249W, and R273C (Fig. 1A). A p53 null clone containing the puromycin selection marker, but no p53 sequences from exons 4 to 9, and positive control lines expressing either the common tumor mutant, R248W, or WT p53 were also generated. The immortalized Hupki (human p53 knock-in) cell line COMN72 with wild-type human TP53 sequences and primary wild-type Trp53 MEFs served as additional controls (16). We have shown previously with the IMCE/MEF platform procedure that cassettes with common tumor p53 mutants produce greater numbers of colonies, and the cells proliferate more quickly than cells derived from cassettes encoding functional p53. Clonogenic potential in the IMCE protocol is thus an initial readout for loss of wild-type p53 function. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, N131Y, R249W, and R248W cassettes demonstrate similar robust colony-forming ability. They produced more than twice the number of colonies (Fig. 1B) containing over five times the cells (Fig. 1C) compared with either a wild-type p53 construct or the Q104L construct. The p53 null TOP construct is even more effective than the mutants in producing colonies, possibly attributable to higher transfection/integration efficiency from the reduced cassette size.  The cell lines were examined by Western blotting for p53 protein expression and activation of p53 response genes following DNA damage (Fig. 2A). As anticipated, all mutant p53 proteins were expressed. Upon treatment with doxorubicin, the p53 variants underwent different levels of phosphorylation and acetylation, with N131Y and R248W exhibiting reduced serine 15 phosphorylation and Lys-379 acetylation (Fig. 2A). The Q104L mutant was the only mutant that showed substantial induction of wild-type p53 targets p21/WAF1 and BBC3/PUMA at levels similar to wild-type p53 (Fig. 2A). All IMCE-derived p53 mutant lines displayed high p19/ARF expression compared with either the (WT) COMN72 cell line or primary WT MEFs. Furthermore, integration and expansion occurred in the absence of any dramatic alteration in either pRb or cyclin D1 expression. Substantial phosphorylation of H2A.x (\\u03b3H2A.x) was evident, indicating DNA damage following doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2A).  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. Immunoblot and immunocytofluorescence analysis of IMCE clones. A, untreated or treated (doxorubicin, 0.5 \\u03bcm, 24 h) IMCE-derived MEF clones were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies together with wild-type Hupki MEFs ... The mutant clones were examined by confocal microscopy for nuclear accumulation of p53 and p21/WAF1 induction following DNA damage with camptothecin (Fig. 2B). In agreement with immunoblots shown in Fig. 2A, WT and Q104L displayed marked nuclear p53 and p21/WAF1 accumulation following DNA damage. In contrast, the clones expressing common tumor mutants or the N131Y mutant showed substantial nuclear p53 levels but little or no p21/WAF1 expression under control conditions, although slight enhancement of p53 expression was evident after treatment. To assess the influence of the various mutants on p53 transcriptional transactivation, qRT-PCR was performed to examine induction of p21/Waf1, Mdm2, Cyclin G1/Ccng1, and Bbc3/Puma following DNA damage. Expression changes were compared against responses in untreated p53 null cells and expressed as ratios relative to GAPDH. Only cell lines expressing Q104L demonstrated significantly elevated p21/Waf1, Cyclin G1/Ccng1, and Mdm2 mRNA amounts compared with p53 null cells, with levels approaching wild-type expressing cells (Fig. 2C). However, very little induction of Bbc3/Puma was detected for any of the mutants.  Introduction of N131Y but Not Q104L Promotes Cell Proliferation and Migration Cell proliferation was examined over a 4-day growth period. Cells derived from TOP constructs (Q104L, N131Y, R248W, R273C, R248W, WT, and null) were stained, and levels were expressed as a ratio change relative to day 1 levels. The N131Y mutant displayed the highest level of growth, becoming particularly evident as the cells neared confluence at day 4. This was significantly greater than what we observed with p53 null cells (Fig. 3A). The Q104L clones displayed growth similar to wild-type expressing cells, and this rate of growth was significantly lower than when p53 was absent (Fig. 3A). Proliferation analysis by BrdU incorporation also revealed highest incorporation in N131Y cells (Fig. 3B). Cell migration toward serum-containing media was determined using a Transwell assay, and the number of migrated cells was expressed as a ratio relative to the p53 null cells. N131Y-expressing cells migrated 80% more effectively than p53 null cells (Fig. 3C). The R249W, R273C, and R248W cells showed between 40\\u201350% enhancement in cell migration relative to p53 null cells. There was no significant influence of either WT p53 or Q104L on cell migration (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these findings indicate that the N131Y mutation has a gain-of-function effect on cells in enhancing proliferation and migration when compared against cells with no p53 expression.  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Introduction of N131Y mutation into p53 null MEFs confers a gain-of-function phenotype. A, cell growth was measured over a 4-day period and expressed as a ratio of day 1 levels. B, proliferation was measured by BrdU ELISA following treatment with doxorubicin ... N131Y Gain-of-function Activity Is Reduced by Introduction of the Global Second-site Suppressor Mutation, N239Y The introduction of secondary intragenic mutations suppressing the effects of primary tumor mutations has the potential to restore wild-type p53 activity and would allow investigation into the effects of recovering p53 wild-type activity in mutant cells (17). We introduced the global suppressor mutation N239Y into the N131Y construct to create cells expressing the double mutant N131Y/N239Y. Introduction of this construct into platform MEFs significantly reduced both colony size (Fig. 4A) and number (Fig. 4B), compared with N131Y alone, although colony formation remained higher than for either WT or N239Y cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Although total p53 protein expression or accumulation following DNA damage with doxorubicin was unchanged between the mutants (Fig. 4C), significant restoration of serine 15 (serine 18 in the mouse) and serine 37 phosphorylation occurred in the double mutant (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 1). Curiously, acetylation of lysine 379 (Lys-379) was almost completely absent in the N131Y mutant (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 1). Note that exposure times were longer than those used for presenting a comparison of all mutants and WT p53 in Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the addition of N239Y was able to significantly enhance acetylation at this site (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 1). However, attenuated acetylation at lysine 379 does not appear to be a general attribute of p53 mutant cells because cells with some common tumor mutants (i.e. R249W and R273C) responded to DNA damage by acetylating this residue to levels equivalent to WT cells (Fig. 2A). Regardless, the alterations in p53 post-translational modifications evident between the single and double mutants were accompanied by elevated protein levels of the p53 target gene products, p21/WAF1, MDM2, and BBC3/PUMA (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 1). The increased post-translational site modifications exhibited by the double mutant may contribute to the restoration of wild-type activity.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Introduction of a second-site suppressor mutation to N131Y increases wild-type p53 activity. Platform MEFs transfected with indicated TOP plasmids were selected in puromycin-containing media for 7 days before assessment of colony size (A) and colony formation ... To further assess restoration of p53 transcriptional activity to N131Y in the presence of the N239Y suppressor mutation, qRT-PCR was performed. Substantial increases in p21/Waf1, cyclin G1/Ccng1, and Mdm2 mRNA were observed in N131Y/N239Y cells compared with either N131Y alone or p53 null cells (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. 1). Expression levels generally approached half of those achieved upon re-expression of wild-type p53 regardless of DNA damage status (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. 1). However, only small changes in Bbc3/Puma mRNA expression were observed for the double mutant, with slight transcriptional trans-activation noted upon doxorubicin treatment (18 h, 0.5 \\u03bcm). Thus, the presence of the N239Y mutation together with N131Y recovers several wild-type p53 activities in the mutant.  To evaluate the consequences to cell behavior of partially restoring wild-type p53 activity to N131Y, cellular proliferation was assessed by crystal violet staining over a 4-day period to compare p53 null, N131Y, and N131Y/N239Y cell growth (Fig. 5A). N131Y grew the most rapidly, whereas the double mutant grew at a rate even lower than observed for p53 null cells (Fig. 5A). Analysis of proliferation by monitoring BrdU uptake also showed a reduction in S phase cells upon introduction of N239Y to N131Y (data not shown). Next, we assessed whether the presence of N239Y in conjunction with N131Y could blunt the enhanced cell migration observed for N131Y in Transwell assays (see Fig. 3C). Indeed, the N131Y/N239Y double mutant displayed a 30% reduction in migration compared with N131Y alone (Fig. 5B). Finally, to compare the apoptotic response in the single and double mutants, we treated N131Y, N131Y/N239Y, and p53 null cells with camptothecin. Whereas the apoptotic fraction of N131Y cells doubled upon treatment to 12% of cells (a level slightly higher than exhibited by p53 null cells), >20% of cells expressing the double mutant showed induction of apoptosis as measured by annexin V binding (Fig. 5C).  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. N131Y gain-of-function activity is reduced when the N239Y mutation is also present. A, growth of p53 null, N131Y, and N131Y/N239Y cells was determined over a 4-day period, and changes were expressed as a ratio relative to day 1. B, Transwell migration ... To confirm that the increased proliferative and migratory response was due to N131Y expression, we depleted p53 from IMCE-targeted MEFs using siRNA (control scrambled or p53-specific). Efficient knockdown of p53 was achieved following 48 h of treatment (Fig. 5D). There was altered functional output as demonstrated by knockdown of N131Y reducing cell proliferation by 15% (Fig. 5E) and cell migration by 22% (Fig. 5F). In contrast, loss of N131Y/N239Y increased both proliferation and migration, perhaps reflecting release from p21-mediated inhibition (Fig. 5, D\\u2013F). There was no significant effect on null cells upon siRNA treatment.  To explore the molecular mechanisms by which N131Y influences cell proliferation, we next examined expression of the cell cycle regulators, cyclin A and cdk1, by Western blotting (Fig. 5G). No significant difference in either cyclin A or cdk1 between null and N131Y cells under normal growth conditions was observed. However, following depletion of N131Y p53 by siRNA, both cyclin A and cdk1 levels were reduced by 30% (Fig. 5, H and I). No change in cdk6 expression was evident. Expression in Null cells were unaffected by siRNA treatment. These results suggest N131Y actively influences levels of specific cell cycle regulators, thereby promoting proliferation.  A critical gauge of p53 activity in primary MEFs is the induction of senescence upon prolonged culturing. Sustained treatment with a low dose of DNA damaging agent can enhance this senescent population. We examined whether early passage N131Y/N239Y cells showed elevated levels of senescence compared with N131Y and p53 null cells. The senescent population was also compared against cells expressing WT p53. As expected, the expression of N131Y/N239Y significantly increased the percentage of \\u03b2-galactosidase-positive cells following doxorubicin treatment (72 h, 0.1 \\u03bcm; Fig. 6A) compared with N131Y and p53 null cells, which failed to show significant changes in senescent population. Cells expressing wild-type p53 were the most effective in inducing senescence following DNA damage (Fig. 6A). The second-site mutation may thus contribute to a reduction in N131Y oncogenic potential by partially recovering p53 control of senescence.  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Effect of the N239Y second-site mutation on the impact of N131Y on cell senescence and growth in soft agar. A, percentage of senescent cells before and after doxorubicin (Dox; 0.1 \\u03bcm, 3 days) treatment was determined as a percentage of \\u03b2-galactosidase-positive ... The ability of cells to survive and proliferate in soft agar (i.e. anchorage-independent growth) is a well characterized hallmark of an oncogenic phenotype. We assessed whether the presence of any of the mutations characteristic of AA exposure could evoke colony formation. Double mutant N131Y/N239Y cells were also examined. In these experiments, we included a control cell population consisting of genetically un-manipulated MEFs expressing the normal endogenous Trp53 gene (E67). Cells were examined 21 days after seeding. Examples of colony morphology are shown in Fig. 6B, which shows single cells or representative colonies from Null, N131Y, N131Y/N239Y, R249W, R248W, Q104L, and WT cells. Colonies per field were counted and colony-forming ability was expressed as a ratio relative to p53 null cells. N131Y expression resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in colony number (Fig. 6C). This was completely ablated by the co-presence of the N239Y mutation (Fig. 6C). Surprisingly, R249W was unable to stimulate further colony growth above that of the p53 null state. As expected, WT MEFs (E67) failed to produce any colonies (Fig. 6C). Average colony size was also determined and expressed relative to single cell averages (Fig. 6D). Both N131Y and R249W cells produced colonies larger than p53 null cells, whereas N131Y/N239Y, WT, and Q104L colonies were on average smaller than the null colonies. These findings show that the N131Y mutation allows for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and that the effect is blocked when the N239Y intragenic mutation is also present.  To confirm the gain-of-function effect of N131Y p53 in additional non-fibroblastic cellular models, baby mouse kidney cells were isolated from platform mice and subjected to IMCE. Similar to MEFs, N131Y was highly expressed in the absence of DNA damage and was unable to induce p21 accumulation beyond that of p53 null cells. N131Y/N239Y was stabilized following DNA damage with doxorubicin and cells exhibited elevated p21 and pRb expression compared with null or N131Y cells (Fig. 7A). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear p53 expression in BMKs coupled with peripheral accumulation of N-cadherin at cell-cell contacts reminiscent of epithelial cells (Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. 2). Importantly, N131Y was able to increase BMK proliferation as measured by both short term BrdU incorporation (Fig. 7C) and analysis of cell growth during a 4-day period (Fig. 7D). Crucially, N131Y/N239Y cells had a significant growth disadvantage compared with either null or N131Y cells (Fig. 7, C and D). Similar to MEFs, N131Y BMK cells also displayed elevated cyclin A and cdk1 levels compared with the p53 null state (Fig. 7, E and F).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. N131Y promotes cell growth and migration of BMK cells. A, BMKs were isolated from 5-day-old mice and subjected to IMCE with null, N131Y, or N131Y/N239Y constructs. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. B, confocal ... Finally, we examined whether N131Y could influence the growth and migration of human cancer epithelial cells. The p53 null lung carcinoma line, H1299, was stably transfected with either N131Y or empty vector control (supplemental Fig. 2C). Cells were examined for p53 expression by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 3A) and immunofluorescence microscopy (supplemental Fig. 3B). No change in p21 was evident; however, a small, reproducible increase in cyclin A/cdk1 could be detected. Strong nuclear expression of N131Y was achieved in the absence of DNA damage (supplemental Figs. 2C and 3B). Cells expressing N131Y displayed increased proliferation (\\u223c20%) as determined by elevated BrdU incorporation (supplemental Fig. 3C). Cell migration was also significantly enhanced upon expression of N131Y (supplemental Fig. 3D). A 23% increase in cells migrating toward a serum gradient was noted (supplemental Fig. 3E). When taken together, these results suggest that the N131Y mutant retains its proliferative and migratory advantages when expressed in epithelial cells.  Go to: DISCUSSION To discover the effects of N131Y and Q104L on p53 biology, we generated a panel of isogenic TP53 mutant cell clones by site-specific recombination at the Trp53 locus of primary MEFs isolated from p53 platform mice (13). The targeting plasmid includes human TP53 sequences from exons 4\\u20139 (human p53 knock-in, Hupki) and restores a complete p53 gene under control of the endogenous Trp53 promoter in the recombinant clones. Previous work has demonstrated that cells and mice with p53 alleles containing wild-type human p53 sequences are similar to their genetically unmodified Trp53 counterparts, whereas Hupki alleles harboring human tumor mutations produce cancer-prone mice (Li-Fraumeni syndrome mouse models) and cells with compromised wild-type p53 activities (18\\u201320).  In the present study, we found that IMCE-derived N131Y MEFs but not Q104L MEFs display dysfunctional properties typical of common TP53 human tumor mutations. Apoptotic and senescence responses to DNA damage and induction of key p53 target genes are compromised in the N131Y mutant, and it proliferates rapidly, even in soft agar. This latter property may be due to the combined loss of p21 expression and a novel ability of N131Y to promote or stabilize cyclin A/cdk1 expression. Furthermore, the second-site rescue mutation N239Y partially recovers wild-type activity to N131Y in both a MEF and BMK cell system. Suppressor TP53 mutations have been constructed and examined in yeast for their ability to restore the transcriptional profile typical of wild-type p53 to common tumor mutants (21, 22). Second-site mutation modeling studies are being pursued to assist in design of drugs that recover p53 function by mimicking the effects of suppressor amino acid substitutions on p53 conformation, DNA binding, and interaction with protein partners (23, 24).  We have previously reported the isolation of rare AA hot spot mutant MEFs following exposure of primary MEFs from the human p53 knock-in (Hupki) strain to the carcinogen and recovery of immortalized clones that harbor p53 mutants (25). Examination of human mutations in Hupki MEFs has proved to be instructive in elucidating p53 mutant behavior and the role of cancer agents in causing human tumors (26\\u201328). In support of data shown here with the precisely mutated IMCE clones, comparisons among Hupki MEF immortalized cell lines isolated following AA exposure showed that the AA-N131Y cell line proliferated much more rapidly than the Q104L cells, accumulated more nuclear p53 under control conditions (a characteristic of well studied common tumor mutations in neoplastic cells), and was more refractory to induction of p53 target gene expression following DNA damage.4  Molecular modeling suggests that the N131Y mutation alters p53 global conformation, an effect opposed by N239Y (supplemental Fig. 4). The Asn-131 residue is located in the S2\\u2013S2\\u2032 \\u03b2 hairpin, and the side chain amide displays hydrogen bonding interactions with Ser-10 via the backbone carbonyl of Ser-269 and Ser-2 through the side chain OH in Thr-126 (supplemental Fig. 4A). The hydrogen-bonding network in the wild-type structure is expected to be lost in N131Y, and the tyrosine residue may lead to a conformational change and destabilization of the p53/DNA complex and/or a decrease in DNA binding. The second-site suppressor mutation, N239Y, is located in the L3 loop between \\u03b2-strands Ser-8 and Ser-9 (supplemental Fig. 4B). In the native structure, the side chain amide sits in a hydrophobic cleft between the side chain of Leu-139 and the CHCH2 group, which links deoxyribose and the phosphate in DNA. In the N239Y structure, the phenyl ring is located in this cleft, which is expected to result in more favorable hydrophobic interactions, relative to wild type, as reported previously (29, 30). Thus, the addition of N239Y to N131Y may partially compensate for the destabilizing effect of the latter mutation and help restore DNA binding. The Q104L mutation, which confers a phenotype approaching that of cells with WT p53, is located in the N terminus at the protein-solvent interface, and no significant effects on conformation are predicted. Modeling of the two rare AA-associated mutants thus supports the experimental data, indicating that the N131Y mutant has a stronger detrimental impact on cellular homeostasis than the Q104L mutant.  The most plausible conclusion of our findings is that N131Y contributes directly to neoplastic development in urothelial tumorigenesis, and data from second-site suppressor experiments suggest that targeting this mutant in cancer cells could have therapeutic benefit. AA is now classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1A carcinogen (International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Series); nevertheless, it is feared that due to use of herbal preparations containing Aristolochia, exposure was, and perhaps remains, widespread, with estimates in the millions in Taiwan alone (9, 31). Given that the A\\u2192T mutation at codon 131 is tightly linked to AA exposure and appears to be otherwise so rare that it has the potential to serve as a specific biological marker of AA exposure and early disease, analogous to the R249S hot spot mutant in aflatoxin-exposed patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (32). The second reiterated AA-linked mutation we investigated that is likewise exceedingly rare in all other cancers, Q104L, appears to have small or negligible effects on cell proliferation, senescence, apoptosis, or cell migration. Conceivably, the A\\u2192T Q104L mutations in AA-associated urothelial cancers are passengers, attributable to preferred electrophilic attack by AA on adenine at this sequence context, and contributing to overall mutation load but not to phenotypic change. Our observations on the biological impact of N131Y support the choice of this mutant as a biomarker of AA exposure and early disease. On a more general note, this study argues that there are still cryptic hotspots in the TP53 human tumor mutation spectrum.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
